          <p>Early this September, <em>The Phillipian</em>, vol. CXXXIX, and <em>The Exonian</em>, vol. CXXXVIII, collaborated to conduct the first-ever survey of all incoming freshmen at Andover and Exeter. The survey, inspired by the annual &ldquo;Senior Survey&rdquo; distributed by &ldquo;The Harvard Crimson&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Yale Daily News,&rdquo; consists of 36 questions and is divided into five main topics: general information, middle school, Andover/Exeter, and perceptions about the two institutions academically, socially, and athletically.</p>
          <p>Of the 221 Juniors (freshmen at Andover) who received the survey, <em>The Phillipian</em> received 169 complete responses &ndash; 76.5 percent of the Class of 2020. Of the 186 Preps (freshmen at Exeter) who received the survey, <em>The Exonian</em> received 157 complete responses &ndash; 84.4 percent of students polled. In the interest of accurately reporting the results of the two surveys, all of the data is presented on a percentage basis and all graphs can be toggled to show individual results from each school.</p>
          <p>We thank the students at Andover and Exeter for their willingness to provide information about themselves and to share their experiences, and we are looking forward to future collaborations between <em>The Phillipian</em> and <em>The Exonian</em> under the joint <em>Non Sibi Press</em> masthead.</p>
          <p><em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: In the interest of releasing the survey as timely as possible, this website went live before</em> The Exonian <em>had concluded their interviews of Exeter students. The website will be updated in due time.</em></p>

          <h1>General</h1>
          <p>The demographics reported by respondents at both Andover and Exeter were remarkably similar racially, ethnically, and religiously. The majority of respondents at both institutions identified as white: 60 percent of the respondents at Exeter, and 63 percent at Andover. Similarly, the majority of students identified as caucasian, which was the most dominant ethnicity at both schools by over 32 percent. Forty-six percent of students from both schools are on some form of financial aid.</p>

          <p>Though students from Andover and Exeter hail from around the world, the 56 percent of boarding freshmen at Andover are local boarders, living in the Northeastern United States. At Exeter, however, only 48 percent of boarding freshmen are from the Northeastern United States.</p>        <div class='content'>
