          <p>Last week, <em>The Phillipian</em>, vol. CXXXIX, and <em>The Exonian</em>, vol. CXXXVIII conducted a survey of Seniors to find out how they were handling the college process. The survey consisted of 18 questions and asked Seniors about stress, applications, and College Counselors. Out of the 319 members of the Class of 2017 at Andover, 282 were surveyed. <em>The Phillipian</em> received 117 complete responses, or 36.6% of the Senior Class. <em>The Exonian</em> received 201 complete responses, 61% of their Senior Class.<p>
          <em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: In the interest of releasing the survey as timely as possible, this website went live before</em> The Exonian <em>had concluded their interviews of Exeter students. The website will be updated in due time.</em></p>

            <p>&ldquo;I started writing the Common App essay over the summer. I did all of the supplements here. It’s good to get some of them out. It just feels good. But the apps are terrible. It was the same common app essay as last year so I had time to work on it. More or less the supplements are all the same. There’s kind of a formula you go through.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think the hardest part about [the application] is trying to write and to make it sound like you. You're trying to write about something that's deeply personal to you and has to have your voice attached to it, it just feels unnatural. It feels unpolished and that doesn't feel like the kind of thing you want to send to the most important place in the world.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>The kind of extracurriculars I do kind of shape the way that I’ve wrote my essay and shaped the way that I’ve kind of presented myself in the application. I do a lot of stuff with CAMD so my essay was very centered around identity. It was very centered around social justice. You rank the kinds of activities that you do on the common app so it was very much my CAMD clubs and my social justice work was at the very top and everything else sort of followed.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It hasn't been that stressful, mainly because I started drafting my essay in the summer, and that is the part that you can control the most. So I think a lot of stress comes from what you can put out there. I just finished the SAT subject tests this October, so I think I'm done with that. I'm just trying to keep up my grades.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It's stressful for sure, but not to the point where I like lose sleep over it or anything. I just know that it will get done, even if the night before. It's really nerve-racking, but it has to get done. So I'm stressed about it, but a healthy amount.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;[Extracurriculars] definitely say and tell more about who I am, and what I like to do, like my passions, which is what admissions want to see. They don't want to see numbers. They want to see what you like to do outside of class, so I think that's a big part about who I am.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I run track and cross country. I was kind of at a point where I wasn't good enough to do the recruiting process, but I want to do it in college whether it's run for a team or do it as a club sport. So, initially when I made my list, I wanted it to be all Division Three schools, but I then opened my mind a little bit and saw that there were so many other schools out there. So that played in a little bit. And then I do film and astronomy extracurricularly so I wanted that to be something I can continue in college and a whole bunch of extracurriculars that are on the list of things.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I’m a coxswain, and I knew going into the recruiting process that it was going to be really hard, but I didn’t expect it to be not being given a straight answer until very late in the application process.&rdquo;</p>
