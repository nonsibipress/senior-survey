          <p>Last week, <em>The Phillipian</em>, vol. CXXXIX, and <em>The Exonian</em>, vol. CXXXVIII conducted a survey of Seniors to find out how they were handling the college process. The survey consisted of 18 questions and asked Seniors about stress, applications, and College Counselors. Out of the 319 members of the Class of 2017 at Andover, 282 were surveyed. <em>The Phillipian</em> received 117 complete responses, or 36.6% of the Senior Class. <em>The Exonian</em> received 201 complete responses, 61% of their Senior Class.<p>

              <h2>Bennett Sherr</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I started writing the Common App essay over the summer. I did all of the supplements here. It’s good to get some of them out. It just feels good. But the apps are terrible. It was the same common app essay as last year so I had time to work on it. More or less the supplements are all the same. There’s kind of a formula you go through.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Jackson Lee</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I think the hardest part about [the application] is trying to write and to make it sound like you. You're trying to write about something that's deeply personal to you and has to have your voice attached to it, it just feels unnatural. It feels unpolished and that doesn't feel like the kind of thing you want to send to the most important place in the world.&rdquo;</p>
            </div>
            <div class='exeter'>
              <h2>Grace Duisberg</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I did most of my app stuff over the summer so I'm not concerned about getting everything done in time for the early app deadline. Rather, I'm in a position where I'd rather just send everything in and be done!&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Katherine Dumoulin</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I've learned that you can't talk about [college] all the time. If you do, it will slowly kill you. It really surprised me that the seniors weren't kidding when they said senior fall is worse than your entire upper year. I was also surprised by how people changed during the [college] process. People start to have different priorities, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. &rdquo;</p>

              <h2>Katherine Wang</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;It hasn't been that stressful, mainly because I started drafting my essay in the summer, and that is the part that you can control the most. So I think a lot of stress comes from what you can put out there. I just finished the SAT subject tests this October, so I think I'm done with that. I'm just trying to keep up my grades.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Nicole Rodriguez</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;It's stressful for sure, but not to the point where I like lose sleep over it or anything. I just know that it will get done, even if the night before. It's really nerve-racking, but it has to get done. So I'm stressed about it, but a healthy amount.&rdquo;</p>
            </div>
            <div class='exeter'>
              <h2>Grant Cammock</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;Honesty the college process has been pretty stressful not gonna lie. I started some of my essays in the summer so that took some of the stress off. But honestly what makes senior fall difficult is that you also have a lot of homework in the classes we take, and finish SAT testing, so there is a lot on our plate, then add that to the college essays.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Katherine Dumoulin</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;You realize that you have to start thinking about you and your future, and it kind of gives people a selfish mindset. I'm not going to lie, I have lost sleep over this process. During the summer, there were a few times where I didn't sleep the entire night because I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen and what the future held for me. I don't think that happens to everyone, but for me, I couldn't let my mind rest about the process.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>&ldquo;The prestige of a college means nothing to me until I visit the place, but I admit that when I visit the college, the prestige probably contributes to how much I like it. &rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Grace Williams</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;Personally, I don't think the hardest part of the process is writing the essays or studying for standardized tests, but finding the perfect place for myself. Rankings and prestige for colleges, for many students at Exeter, have been ingrained as the mark of how successful one is as a student. The college search has changed my viewpoint on this naive concept. I haven't been challenged to change what previously thought about colleges due to their labels, rankings, and names except for when I challenged myself to do so.&rdquo;</p>

              <h2>Ali Nunes</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;She’s been really good because a lot of the questions or a lot of times I’ll have questions about what I should include and what I shouldn’t because there’s a lot of things you can put in your essays, a lot of things you can put in your supplemental information, and she&rsquo;s been really good about being like, &ldquo;do you really need to do that?,&rdquo; and I’ll be like, &ldquo;I guess not, okay,&rdquo; so that&rsquo;s been very helpful.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Janet Conklin</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I feel like your college counselor is as helpful as you want them to be. If you’re proactive about going to college counseling and getting drafts in, they can be a huge resource.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Kelly Sheng</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;It’s actually been pretty smooth in terms of a gradual process. My college counselor’s been really helpful in the sense that he’s checking in and giving helpful feedback, I feel like he’s a pretty integral part of the process.&rdquo;</p>

            <div class='exeter'>
              <h2>Isabel Bagger</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;My college counselor hasn't been very helpful because she always seems to worry more about my feelings toward a certain place, or even protecting my feelings when she thinks I'll get rejected somewhere than she worries about how to actually get me into college. &rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Nada Zohayr</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;My counselor has been very helpful during the process. I found that the best way to utilize CCO is to come in with as many questions as possible because your counselor can help you if they know what they need to help you with.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Bonnie LaBonte</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;CCO and your parents tell you it’s all way off in the distance and it’s no big deal, in reality this is all incredibly time sensitive because of the processing time of test scores, transcripts, and recs. I've kept thinking my apps are due in a month or three when in reality I have one due in two weeks and I can't get a CCO appointment.&rdquo;</p>

              <h2>Nicole Rodriguez</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;It's not necessarily about being a part of every single thing. It's more about being really passionate about specific things.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Katherine Wang</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;[Extracurriculars] definitely say and tell more about who I am, and what I like to do, like my passions, which is what admissions want to see. They don't want to see numbers. They want to see what you like to do outside of class, so I think that's a big part about who I am.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>&ldquo;I run track and cross country. I was kind of at a point where I wasn't good enough to do the recruiting process, but I want to do it in college whether it's run for a team or do it as a club sport. So, initially when I made my list, I wanted it to be all Division Three schools, but I then opened my mind a little bit and saw that there were so many other schools out there. So that played in a little bit. And then I do film and astronomy extracurricularly so I wanted that to be something I can continue in college and a whole bunch of extracurriculars that are on the list of things.&rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Janet Conklin</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;I’m a coxswain, and I knew going into the recruiting process that it was going to be really hard, but I didn’t expect it to be not being given a straight answer until very late in the application process.&rdquo;</p>

              <h2>Katherine Dumoulin</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;When I was little, being a D1 athlete was the only thing I wanted to do. Now, I've realized that with the career path I want to take, committing myself to an intense program for four years has become something I don't want to do. I realized I'd rather apply as an academic and walk on if I wanted to, allowing myself to have the choice to stop if I don't want to do that sport anymore. &rdquo;</p>
              <h2>Charlie Dubiel</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;There are a lot of schools out there, and there were times when I asked myself, "why am I communicating with the coach at X school when I could never see myself there?" I think the same thinking can be used for the application process. Not having to worry about those extra schools saved me time, and allowed me to narrow my focus on what I was really looking for.&rdquo;</p>
